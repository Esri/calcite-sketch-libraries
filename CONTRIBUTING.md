### Things to keep in mind when working on additions to a component library

- Sensible naming and organization of pages, artboards and symbols.
- Consistency in symbol naming, reusing patterns for symbol structure, ensuring no duplication of existing symbols and adequate overrides for customization.
- Symbol instances should usually be named the same as the symbol itself (minus it's path).
- Create an instance of the symbol - play with it, is the structure logical / easy to use? Does it respond appropriately when resized?

### Checklist for reviewing component library additions

- Instances of each symbol are on the Example page(s) in a variety of configurations and sizes.
- Symbol names follow existing patterns.
- Symbol names are unique.
- Symbols likely to be used at different fixed heights are built as multiple symbols (sharing overrides).
- Symbols respond to resizing correctly.
- Symbols support different insets (if applicable).
- Symbol overrides follow existing patterns (e.g. Inset, Left, Right, Color, etc.).
- Symbol override menus only contain options that make sense (make sure override symbol dimensions are unique).
- Symbols include padding and separators necessary for them to snap into correct placement relative to other elements.
- Symbol color overrides default to a generic button/link color instead of black or the tint color for a specific app.
