📦 Using the kit
--

To keep components and parts of a component organized, focusing on the naming of the component first will help the user navigate. From there, it's the type (off, on, empty, error, etc) followed by the state (focus, hover, idle).

1. Every symbol is made up of 3 drill-downs: `Component -> Type -> State`
2. Leverage the symbol panel to change the state of the component along with any applicable overrides.
